Experience

August 2022 – Present
Postdoctoral scholar
EPFL, Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland
- Developed a C++17 module for computing the superconductive logic gate library optimized for area and delay. Parallelized the script to run on 48-core computing cluster;
- Developed the tool for logic synthesis and retiming of multiphase logic networks. Integrated the mockturtle logic synthesis library (C++17) with Google OR-tools (Python 3);
- Developed a Python wrapper script for JoSIM (superconductive SPICE simulator) to support named subcircuit parameters (similar to HSPICE).

May 2020 - August 2020
Intern (Design Automation)
Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, California, USA (Remote)
- Developed Python tool for automated PCB-level power delivery network layout synthesis;
- Reverse-engineered an undocumented layout description format to automatically generate PCB layouts;
- Enabled fast PCB prototype generation and comprehensive early power delivery exploration.

May 2018 - August 2018
Intern (Power Integrity)
Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, California, USA
- Seamlessly integrated MATLAB with HSPICE to optimize power delivery network parameters based on target power-performance-area specifications;
- Efficient early design space exploration for power delivery in high-performance integrated circuits.

June 2017 - June 2022
Research Assistant
University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA
- Developed EDA methodologies and software for VLSI power delivery network design, early system-level exploration, and layout synthesis (funded by Qualcomm);
- Developed algorithms and software for clock distribution network synthesis for superconductive Rapid Single Flux Quantum integrated circuits (funded by Synopsys);
